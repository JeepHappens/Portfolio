	      <h2>About Me</h2>
		</header>
	      <article>Hello, my name is Robert Osterman. I am an aspiring developer of all things interesting and/or useful. I am a 28 year old father of two and husband to a beautiful wife. I spend most of my free time enjoying the great outdoors with my family.</article>

	      <h2>My Background</h2>
		</header>
	      <article>My love of computers began when I was a young man working with my grandfather in his basement. He had a plethora of PC pieces and parts sitting around from working in the computer field for a number of years. Some of those pieces and parts became my first computer that he built for me. After I graduated high school, I spent a year in college before I joined the Army in 2008 where I spent 5 years as a Combat Medic. Since I got out in 2013, I have been focusing on the rehabilitation of injuries incurred during my service and being a dad while my wife pursues her career. </article>

	      <h2>Why I Want to Program</h2>
		</header>
	      <article>Remember the computer Grandpa built? That is where I learned HTML back in 2002. I wound up working full time throughout high school and letting my passion for code fall to the wayside throughout my life. Early in 2017, I made the decision that I wanted to get back into web development and I love it so far. I have discovered that I have a passion for learning everything I can about every language I can. My skills are definitely raw but the desire to perfect them is strong.</article>
